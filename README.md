Parsing Bentley Geopak SMD (XML) file using Python ElementTree

This project is a learning exercise for python, ElementTree and github.

1. Parse the xml to various data formats.
2. Load the data into an excel sheet for bulk editing.
3. Load to sqllite database.
4. Rewrite the xml accordingly.

Note: I removed the namespace line form the xml file in order to simplify things a bit.
